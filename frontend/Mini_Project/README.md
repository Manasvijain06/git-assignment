## Features

## HTML Basic Structure

The project follows a well-structured HTML layout to organize different sections of the dashboard clearly and efficiently.

### Key Sections:

- **Header** – Displays the project title
- **Controls Section** – Includes search, filter, and sorting options
- **Analytics Section** – Shows summary data like total products, total value, and out-of-stock items
- **Product Section** – Displays dynamically rendered product cards
- **Form Section** – Allows users to add or edit products

This structured approach ensures better readability, maintainability, and scalability of the application.
